  abstract = {Recommender models are commonly used to suggest relevant items to a user for e-commerce and online advertisement-based applications. These models use massive embedding tables to store numerical representation of items' and users' categorical variables (memory intensive) and employ neural networks (compute intensive) to generate final recommendations. Training these large-scale recommendation models is evolving to require increasing data and compute resources. The highly parallel neural networks portion of these models can benefit from GPU acceleration however, large embedding tables often cannot fit in the limited-capacity GPU device memory. Hence, this paper deep dives into the semantics of training data and obtains insights about the feature access, transfer, and usage patterns of these models. We observe that, due to the popularity of certain inputs, the accesses to the embeddings are highly skewed with a few embedding entries being accessed up to 10000X more. This paper leverages this asymmetrical access pattern to offer a framework, called FAE, and proposes a hot-embedding aware data layout for training recommender models. This layout utilizes the scarce GPU memory for storing the highly accessed embeddings, thus reduces the data transfers from CPU to GPU. At the same time, FAE engages the GPU to accelerate the executions of these hot embedding entries. Experiments on production-scale recommendation models with real datasets show that FAE reduces the overall training time by 2.3X and 1.52X in comparison to XDL CPU-only and XDL CPU-GPU execution while maintaining baseline accuracy.},

  abstract = {Undoubtedly, one of the greatest issues nowadays is congestion. To face such problem, forecasting of traffic is required. Bayesian combined neural network (BCNN) is applied to four different locations in Kuwait (Cairo Street, Riyadh Street, Maghreb Road and Istiqlal Road) to predict the short-term traffic volume at the middle section due to traffic flow from adjacent intersections. All data were collected for a period of 1 week over 15-min observation intervals using loop detectors. In addition to time-series responses and regression plots, mean square error (MSE) has been used to validate the network performance after data normalization. In comparison with MSE and R values, both values were slightly less precise during weekdays compared to weekends. After standardizing, the average MSE during weekdays was 0.003468 and regression (R) was 0.98113 for the four streets. For weekends model, the average MSE was 0.003563 and regression (R) was 0.97374 for the four streets. Istiqlal Street weekday model was the best model that fits the information among all the four models; as it has the smallest MSE value equivalent to 0.0010087 and the highest R value of 0.9959. BCNN model has achieved outstanding prediction performance with great potential to be generalized for various locations at different times of the day. These results can allow transportation planners to forecast traffic congestions and take prior measures to avoid them. Further modeling can assist in studying factors causing intersection congestions.},
